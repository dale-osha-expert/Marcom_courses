  "electrical-hazards-osha": `**Electrical Hazards and OSHA Standards in Construction — OSHA 1926 Subpart K**

Electricity is one of the leading causes of death on construction sites. Every year, it kills more than a hundred construction workers and injures thousands more — yet most of these incidents could have been prevented. Construction workers suffer more than half of all electrical injuries that occur on the job.

OSHA has established comprehensive electrical safety standards under 29 CFR 1926 Subpart K, which covers all aspects of electrical work in construction environments. Key regulations include:
- **1926.403** — General requirements for electrical installations
- **1926.404** — Wiring design and protection
- **1926.405** — Wiring methods, components, and equipment for general use
- **1926.416** — General requirements for the protection of employees

Electrical energy can cause painful shocks, severe burns, cardiac arrest, and death. The severity of an electrical injury depends on the amount of current flowing through the body, the path it takes, and the duration of contact. Even relatively low voltages can be fatal under the right conditions. Employers have a responsibility under OSHA 1926.416 to protect their workers by ensuring that equipment is properly guarded, grounded, and maintained, and by providing proper training.`,

  "power-lines": `**High Voltage Power Lines — OSHA 1926.1408**

Overhead power lines represent one of the most serious hazards on construction sites. Contact with energized power lines is frequently fatal. A fundamental safety rule: **always assume power lines are energized**, even if they appear de-energized or have been reported as shut off.

OSHA 1926.1408 governs power line safety for equipment operations. Before beginning any work near overhead lines, the employer must:
1. **Determine the voltage** of the nearby lines to establish minimum approach distances
2. Ensure no part of equipment — including loads, cables, booms, or personnel — comes within the minimum approach distance

For power lines up to 50,000 volts, the minimum approach distance is 10 feet. For higher voltages, the required distance increases accordingly.

When work must be performed near power lines, additional protective measures include using insulating barriers, employing a qualified observer to monitor clearances, and having the utility company de-energize and ground the lines whenever possible. Never assume a power line is safe to approach without verification from the utility company.`,

  "tools-cords": `**Tools, Extension Cords, and Receptacles — OSHA 1926.405 & 1926.416**

Construction sites rely heavily on electrical tools and extension cords. When improperly used or maintained, these everyday items become serious electrocution hazards. OSHA 1926.416 requires that employees not work near any part of an electric power circuit unless protected against electric shock.

**Before using any power tool:**
- Inspect it for damage — cracked insulation, bent prongs, damaged housing, or frayed cords
- Never use a tool that shows signs of damage; remove it from service immediately and tag it

**Extension cords:**
- Must be rated for **outdoor use** when used outdoors or in wet locations — indoor-only cords lack proper moisture resistance
- Must be the correct amperage rating for the equipment being used; undersized cords can overheat and cause fires or shocks
- Never use an extension cord with a removed or bypassed grounding prong — the third prong provides the crucial safety path for fault current

Under OSHA 1926.405, all wiring methods, components, and equipment must be free from recognized hazards. Damaged or modified cords are prohibited on construction sites.`,

  "grounding-gfci": `**Grounding, Continuity, and GFCIs — OSHA 1926.404**

Electrical grounding is a fundamental safety measure on construction sites. When electrical equipment is grounded, a safe path is created for fault current to flow to the earth if a short circuit occurs — preventing that current from passing through a worker's body and causing electrocution. Under OSHA 1926.404, all equipment must be properly grounded.

**Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs)** provide an additional, critical layer of protection. A GFCI monitors the current flowing in a circuit and instantly cuts power if even a small ground fault is detected — typically within 1/40th of a second. This is fast enough to prevent a serious or fatal shock.

OSHA 1926.404 requires GFCI protection for **all 120-volt, single-phase, 15- and 20-ampere receptacles on construction sites** that are not part of the permanent wiring of a building or structure. In practice, this covers nearly all temporary electrical receptacles on a job site.

**Continuity** — ensuring that all ground connections are intact and properly maintained — must also be verified regularly. A broken ground wire provides no protection in a fault condition. Regular inspection and testing of GFCIs is essential.`,

  "lockout-tagout": `**Lock-Out/Tag-Out (LOTO) — OSHA 1926 Subpart C**

Electrical equipment must be de-energized before any maintenance, servicing, or repair work is performed. **Unexpected energization** — the accidental re-energization of equipment while someone is working on it — is one of the most dangerous hazards in any work environment. The Lock-Out/Tag-Out (LOTO) system exists specifically to prevent this.

- **Lock-out** means applying a physical lock to the energy-isolating device (such as a circuit breaker) so that equipment cannot be re-energized while work is in progress.
- **Tag-out** means attaching a warning tag to the energy-isolating device to alert others that the equipment must not be energized.

**The proper LOTO sequence:**
1. Identify all energy sources
2. Notify affected employees
3. Shut off the energy source
4. Isolate the energy source
5. Apply your personal lock and tag
6. Verify that energy is truly isolated by attempting to operate the equipment

**Critical rule:** Only the worker who applied the lockout/tagout device is authorized to remove it. Never remove someone else's lock or tag — doing so could result in serious injury or death.`,

    question: "How often should GFCIs be tested on a construction site?",
    answer: "OSHA recommends testing GFCIs **before each use** on construction sites. A GFCI that fails its test provides no ground fault protection and must be taken out of service immediately. Press the \"test\" button — the power should cut off instantly. Then press \"reset\" to restore power.",

    question: "Can I use an indoor-rated extension cord outside if the weather is dry?",
    answer: "No. OSHA 1926.405 requires that extension cords used outdoors or in wet/damp locations must be **rated for outdoor use**, regardless of current weather conditions. Indoor-rated cords lack the moisture resistance and insulation needed for outdoor environments.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do if I find a damaged power tool on the job site?",
    answer: "Under OSHA 1926.416(a), you must **remove the tool from service immediately**, tag it as defective, and report it to your supervisor. Never use a tool with cracked insulation, frayed cords, damaged housing, or missing grounding prongs — even for a quick task.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who can remove a lockout/tagout device?",
    answer: "**Only the worker who installed the device** is authorized to remove it. Removing someone else's lock or tag — even with supervisor permission — is prohibited under normal circumstances. If the original worker is unavailable, the facility's established absent-worker procedure must be followed, which requires management authorization and verification that work is complete.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the minimum safe distance from overhead power lines?",
    answer: "For power lines up to **50,000 volts**, the minimum approach distance is **10 feet**. For higher voltages, the required distance increases. Under OSHA 1926.1408, the employer must first determine the voltage of nearby lines to establish the correct minimum approach distance before any work begins.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does OSHA 1926 Subpart K cover?",
    answer: "**Subpart K — Electrical** covers all electrical safety requirements for construction work. It includes general requirements (1926.403), wiring design and protection (1926.404), wiring methods and equipment (1926.405), and protection of employees (1926.416). It is the primary electrical safety standard for construction sites.",
